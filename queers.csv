1:The place we will meet to describe our ruminations on our selves, and the parts that are hiding from each other. A future moment of queerness, just a few minutes from now*. 
2:10 Pines, as anglos call it, has the first members of its present queer community move in around 7 years ago. Butches, drag queens, naked hippies, kinky femmes, sex workers, queer and trans activists and artists from various economical, cultural and racial backgrounds have slowly been taking over more and more lofts in the building, sleeping in tiny mezzanines and sharing common spaces. This space brought me space to explore my gender, pretty cool kinky technical skills and faith into healthy polyamory.
3:this used to be a queer spot that I liked a lot
4:we argued about the best way to deal with  those who do not respect (u)s, and others, and others still more other but still more like us then like them. underneath this was a feeling of insufficiency from me. the cook was a cutie. he made us poutine.
5:A riverside sunset gay/queer frolic took place for pervers/cite. I felt like i'd found home. 
6:Location of the Queering the Map Residency at the Fine Arts Reading Room
7:This is the building where both TRUXX and Mystique were. They were core parts of the Peel/Stanley neighbourhood in the 70's, and Mystique was Mtl's oldest gay bar until its doors closed in 2009. On October 22nd 1977, both bars were raided by police and more than 400 people arrested and thrown in jail. The resulting protests were more than 3000 strong, and are credited in part with the passage of Law 88, which made QC the first province to criminalize discrimination based on sexuality. 
8:Androgyny / Librarie l’Androgyne (Montréal's first LGBT bookstore 1973-2002)NEWLINENEWLINE“ on Crescent Street south of Ste-Catherine in a space two steps down from the sidewalk” -Archives Gaies du Québec NEWLINENEWLINE"Androgyny quickly became a gathering place for people influenced by and participating in the various sexual liberation movements of the sixties and seventies. Women would bring in their children to look at children's books, sharing the space with gay men browsing through periodicals for shirtless guys. While we always expected there to be some conflict between our varied constituencies, that never happened; perhaps because of the accepting attitudes modelled by ourselves and Barbara[..] We would frequently see men repeatedly passing by the book store, looking non-chalantly at the titles in the windows with each pass, before gathering the courage to enter. I've encountered many men years later who told me that their first step in coming out was walking through the door of the bookstore, which gave them the courage and resources they needed to move further.[...]Unbeknownst to us when we first moved onto the street, there happened to be a gay sauna in the same building. Interestingly, there were many gay men who found it more frightening to come into the bookstore than going to the sauna; the latter being, however intimate, a much more anonymous venture than the former." - Bruce Garside, one of the first owners of the shop NEWLINE
9:the Chutes St Marguerite are a sunbathing and cruising spot, have been for decades. My friends and I go there every summer, just to sit and have a picnic usually. There's a way the rocks have been worn away that you can use as a slide. 
10:used to be Baby Face Disco (1956-1980s), Montréal's first "lesbian-only drinking establishment", managed and bounced (sometimes with a baseball bat) by the eponymous, reclusive one-time wrestler Baby Face 
11:This is where we had our first kiss and also where we both really made love to a woman for the first time.
12:I "got into" karaoke for the sole reason to impress you, even though I hated singing in front of other people.
13:Former location of Feminist/Queer print shop Atelier Lost Cause, allowing affordable access to Queer/Femme folx to printing equipment for projects. Lost cause to the inevitable realization that Montréal is a difficult place for artists without sufficient resources. R.I.P. 
14:cement graffiti with two (very old-school seeming now) venus symbols in a heart i walk past every day on my way to the metro. 
15:I'm 13. In our all-girl after school dance troupe, I'm awkwardly standing in the back of the room. My sweatpants are not as nice as the other girls'. The girls almost all white. The teacher is gorgeous and she dances really well. The other girls dance better then I do, but she still puts me at the front row. 
16:Fall of last year, we're laughing and sitting on the ledge of the bridge at Parc Saint-Viateur. We hold hands and I feel like I'm in a coming of age movie. 
17:Cheskie's. I slept over at your house and we're now grabbing breakfast.  You're leaving for a few months, and I guess I might not see you again. I think to myself that I will come back here to have a snack when I miss you. 
18:I'm half an hour late to our first date. You're pretty nervous and I'm dying inside because you're so goddamn cute.
19:A bunch of nerdy closeted asian girls hanging out at the mall. I'm in love with A who's in love with B who"s in a relationship with C. We all go to Ardene and buy matching spikey earrings. It took me an hour to get here in bus. 
20:Almost every day during the summer I come to your house and sit on the floor while you play piano. 
21:At what used the be the Royal Phoenix, I am 16 and my boyfriend's sister brings us here. It's packed with well-dressed queerdos and I feel like a loser. We don't even go in.NEWLINEYears later, girls' night out with my best friend. We pretend that we are dating each other so the boys leave us alone. We end up making out and having going home with another girl. This is a start of a two month period where we vaguely date each other. 
22:I'm not gay enough yet to hang out with the gays. 
23:Summer camp. I'm a tiny 7 yr old girl and Gougoune. my favorite counselor picks me up. I poke her tits and she's (understandably) pretty pissed. Oops....
24:my absolute favorite makeout bench. In summer the grass is tall enough that no one sees you, but you can watch the cars drive by and the sun go down.
25:The Drugstore was one of the last lesbian bars in Montreal. It closed in 2013. It was a huge 3-story building with balconies on each floor from which you could see drag queen shows on the center stage. 
26:I asked if you wanted to make out, you looked to see if we were in the champ-de-vision of the dude you were seducing at the time, and we kissed for a minute.
27:You're the first girl to ever hit on me. I was really flustered.
28:The perfect date, "Le temps est bon" could be the soundtrack of. I said "it's unconventional, but I like it", and you both laughed.
29:It wasn't meant to be a flirtatious moment. You were a friend of my room mate, we were supposed to meet up at the front of the mountain to play music. My room mate never showed up, so it was the two of us. You played guitar and I recited some poems. We were still teenagers. It's corny when I think about it. You told me you had a girlfriend, and in my head I felt jealousy and anger, it didn't make sens. But at that moment I understood I could be in love with a man. 
30:I asked you to stop calling people f*gs, and you wondered why I was so concerned for people who are not like me, but I did not tell you I was just like them.
31:I never was one for PDA but we made out so endlessly next to the fire on the train tracks. Sparks were literally flying. I was asked if I wanted to join Queer Sprayers that night as well. A very seminal summer night.
32:former location of Saint-Emilie Skillshare, a community run QTPOC centered PWYC/DIY screen printing studio, with various other workshops, events, and activities happening in the space as well. Another space lost to gentrification of the southwest. 
33:formerly The Decadent Squalor, queer venue in Saint Henri. Home to many queer dance parties, punk shows and queer angels. 
34:never felt `'queer enough' to say it aloud, but i know you know that i really want to kiss you. 
35:you told me you still weren't ready to sleep with a woman but when you did you wanted it to be me 
36:Had a first (Tinder) date with a beautiful girl.
37:It was here that on one rainy Sunday I finally gathered the courage to break up with my boyfriend and shout for one last time "How many times have I told you that I think I'm gay?!"
38:we cuddled and kissed under the stars, it was the first time I showed this kind of affection with a woman in public and i felt so whole
39:I was so nervous to kiss you but managed to play it cool.
40:The first time I slept with a woman confused the hell out of me. 
41:I realize now that I hated you because I wanted to love you.
42:Where I loved you, where you left me.
43:you told me to come closer, and my life changed.
44:You were older, you were a woman, we kissed and I forgot my background, it has been 3 years... I love you 
45:<3 royal phoenix <3 now it's a gentrifying bro bar with a ping pong table but the name lives on in royal sous marin
46:i biked all the way to a house party here from the mile end bc i knew they'd be there but outside the door i got shy and biked back
47:She gave me my first orgasm under the trees in that park. We were both dressed in black from head to toe.
48:We got caught frolicking in their bathroom and were rudely asked to leave.
49:Being queer
50:A Catholic residential college where I first had sex with my girlfriend (or any girl ever) in my dorm room
51:It was summer,you came to visit me. it was a beautiful day for a walk. we lay on the grass and just talked. you helped me do some math. i felt so greatful that you're the person ive spent all these years with. kept thinking how much i love being with you
52:Saying goodbye to a girl I was dating with a kiss, we were stopped by a gross old man that said something in French I couldn't understand. She wouldn't tell me what he said. 
53:3825, I celebrated Mardi Grad with my friends here. I'm Australian and Mardi Gras is like Pride at home. I was sad to be missing it, so they threw me a dinner party. They didn't really understand the concept so made me Cajun food and put a gay pride flag. It was lovely and made me feel very welcome.
54:I came out for the first time here. I was only 15 and not ready at all. It was the first time I ever outwardly admitted my queerness to anyone, including myself.
55:Many nights spent here dancing and feeling the safest I have ever felt my whole life.
56:I was living in a shithouse apartment, sleeping on a mattress on the floor that had really bad bed bugs, halfway across the world in one the strangest cities I have ever lived in. I took a tab of acid and watched Sasha Velour's 'Nightgown' videos on Youtube and weeped because of the artistry and because I was so happy to be queer. 
57:SUPER GAY
58:A gay cowboy bar called 'Saddles' where queer women bought me so many shots of tequila that I passed out on the street. My friends said that if the cops drove past when they were trying to get me into the Uber, it would have looked like they were smuggling a dead body. 
59:It was the summer and I was just another Canadian tourist. There's an h&m around here. I was still very closeted at the time, but I saw the most beautiful woman go past me on the escalator opposite myself. I expressed to the friend I was with how I thought she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. It was then that I knew I should come out soon to more people.
60:Glebe Waterfront, I watched the sunrise here with my girlfriend after a really long night. I had a panic attack one of the only all nighter bars in Sydney that we went to last as we were the only queer girls there and predatory men kept hitting on us. We left through a back entrance, grabbed some food and came here to have a picnic as the sun rose. She made me laugh so much that I told her I thought I was falling in love with her. 
61:The biggest party of the year consisted of a drag show, with queens coming all the way from Montreal. For the first time since I had moved here, I actually did not feel alone, the queers came out on that night. 
62:My rural hometown where I realised I might be queer by listening to Courtney Barnett - it's such a cliche and I'm a little embarrassed by it. 
63:we were eating tacos and i realized i had a crush on you
64:Where 30,000+ people (the largest queer rights rally Australia has ever seen) gathered to protest for a Yes! vote in the Marriage Equality plebiscite. It was amazing to walk down the street with my friends and not see the beginning in front of us or the end behind us of people who supported queer love in Australia.  
65:The Midnight Shift, a gay bar which has since closed down, where I met my girlfriend. I almost didn't go out that night as I'd been out the previous couple, but my tentatively queer friend really wanted to go to this SHADES party being thrown by USYD, so I went with her. I'm glad I did. 
66:listening to sufjan stevens with other queer friends in high school before we had officially come out to one another
67:the most passionate kissing i`ve allowed myself so far
68:On est allées au jam de feu à l'été, bu trop de vin cheap pis on s'est s'embrassées pour la première fois avec les flammes pis du folk sale tout autour. / We went to the fire jam during the summer, drank too much cheap wine and kissed for the first time with flames and folk punk all around.
69:We went on our first date here, it was winter and we were both biking there. Seeing you in the snow on your fixie made my heart beat really fast. Later we kissed and went for falafel, you were beautiful and I couldn't wait to see you again.
70:Our first date
71:You took me to the one club in this part of the city and we made out on the dancefloor. I was used to men harassing two girls kissing, but everyone in there stayed far away from us. We might have broken a law.
72:First time I kissed a girl - we were both very trans and very cute.
73:You picked me up from my parent's house at 1am during a power outage and drove me to the beach. We skinny-dipped and then you took me for soup. I was pretty sure we were falling for each other.
74:A girl told my friend "Every time I see you I get butterflies and my heart flutters!"
75:You wouldn't take me to prom because you didn't want to come out. We had been dating for 6 months, and to this day I wonder: were you ashamed of me?
76:What used to be the acon building where my friends and I had the Q to q youth group every week for three years in high school. The facilitator liked the same bands as me.
77:The mini park where I sat down in the grass and rang my (gay) uncle and came out to him as bi at fifteen or sixteen, and he told me I was strong and brave and that he'd look out for me.
78:The gazebo next to the tennis courts where my friends and I played gay chicken on thursdays instead of doing school sports.
79:Where I took you when I decided it was time we get to know each other beyond just our usual drunk sex.
80:The spot where I first got called a faggot out of a moving car. It was a bunch of surfer guys hanging out a kombi van and it sounded a bit like faggoooOOOOOOOoooooot as they went past. It was a moment of pride rather than pain for young me, who had felt invisible until then.
81:We made eye contact on the dance floor and 30 minutes later you found me again. I'm glad you did.
82:We had our first date here. You were late and I had barely made it out. Four months later you broke my heart.
83:The squatted building where we held the two-day anarchist "Rad Queer Fest" in January 2017 - We had talks and films and music and dancing and chats and raised $1500 in donations for a local Aboriginal Justice initiative. Miranda Devine later lost her shit over the building and called us "The militant wing of the yes campaign"... five months after it had already been demolished (which, I might add, happened before the postal survey was even announced).
84:We were sweaty and covered in glitter. You were high and I was hitting on your friend. I'm glad I added you on Facebook that night, because it was a pleasure to date you while you were in Canada.
85:Had my first casual fling with a cis boy in an abandoned building here. He was really into my trans body and not in a fetishistic way! He was kind and fun and considerate and we really enjoyed each other's company. He moved back to India a year ago but we still keep in touch.
86:Twenty10, a queer youth support service!
87:The spot where my best friend in the world asked me out in high school and we held hands together. Seven years later, we're still best friends.
88:First date with a girl at greater union cinema. We watched Tangled and held hands, then she moved to Denmark a few days later.
89:I was gay in this park
90:My dad and I taught my partner to drive in my late grandpa's red 1980 subaru ute on my family's farm.
91:The Court, a gay bar. A girl and I had been mutually eyeing each other off all night, but were both too shy to talk to each other. Both our respective groups of friends forced us to dance together. We were awkward but she bought me a flower and I went back to her friend's hotel room and drank pink moscato with her until we fell asleep. :)
92:The caravan park my family was living in when I cut off all my hair at 15 - my first major step away from identifying as a girl.
93:Me and a friend lived here for 18 months - so much happened here that I can hardly sum it up. It was beautiful. 
94:Went camping here with one of my favourite queers (among others)! It was indescribably beautiful.
95:Kissed a fellow nb-babe! Had sex w that babe! GAY
96:Looked at some mushrooms, smoked some cones, it was gay.
97:Spotted a furry in a gimp mask. Idk about them but I was gay at the time of viewing.
98:Met my best friend here, we were 12 - 10 years later we’re still best friends and trans and queer as all get out. 
99:Watched the sunset from the train w a beautiful girl.
