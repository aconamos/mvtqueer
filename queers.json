Everytime I think of you.\n\nI won't prosecute you. As much as I am against criminalization of HIV-positive people, I am equally against the criminalization of mentally-ill poeple. I learned in the months that followed my diagnosis that you are bipolar, schizophrenic and depressive. The irregular intake of all your medications is the cause of your contagious viral load that infected me.\n\nYou killed a part of me. I brought another one to life.

You were interning downtown and our schedules finally worked for us to hang out. But our hang-outs involved us naked and learning how to kiss and give proper blowjobs. It was the summer before college and we had been sexting and hooking up regularly and irregularly, respectively, since sophomore year. We had never gone there but the gray fog made us more lustful than usual that day. We caught up in the kitchen and began to tease each other. I'd play with your messy hair and you'd rub my shoulders. Still, the feeling of bodily affection was foreign so I played it off because I was so against you wanting me. I found it foolish and wrote it off as circumstantial. We were in rare quantities despite our queer surroundings. We decided to watch a movie on my laptop in my bedroom which was all red. The wallpaper, linens, curtains, all a deep crimson as if it was straight out of a gothic estate.  I, too, was red. Our bodies laid in deep magnet repel. We wanted them to do what they had done before, but uncertainty kept me wanting. But the sexual tension was emanating off us. We were typical angsty queer teens that so desperately wanted acceptance. So we accepted each other. It began with you playing with my ear lobe. I was coy about the whole things but grabbed your hand and began to suck your index fingers. I closed my eyes as I simulated the forthcoming on your fingers. You released gentle moans of pleasure. I opened my eyes and was met with your knowing gaze. It was the look that gave our bodies permission to take over and do what we had ultimately come to do. We had begun to know each other's bodies. You enjoyed me gently tickling your testicles as I teased your erect cock and you know I liked having my nipples sucked before I came. We had become proficient in making out with each other. Our cocks collided with one another, yours dominating. This dance had become enough but something felt different this last time. I began to move away from your mouth but you fought back and won me with your pillowy lips. I could not get enough of you. I eventually started to go down on you. You moaned with pleasure as I put the tip of my tongue into your cock's opening. That's when I knew something else was going on. I traveled up and down the coasts of your cock, leaving no spot untouched. I could hear you panting. I briefly looked up and saw that your eyes were closed but your mouth was opened, hushed, gentle moans. Your expression left me thinking that you could not believe the pleasure you were receiving. That looks haunts me to this day. With every sexual partner since I search for this look, I yearn for this look. I was rock hard but only needed that brief look to take me to the edge. You enjoyed me salivating over your primrose cock so I was repeating that motion over and over. Teasing your head and blowing on it to give you the sensation. Your cock was getting more and more engorged so I knew it was time. You could barely inch out the \"Imma cum\" before you blew your load. But unlike before, I was still working your head. You filled my mouth with sweet tasting custard I have yet to taste again. You gave me a look of horror once you had saw what you did. But I only remembered the joy. I swished your cum into my mouth and licked my lips for any remaining drop. I took a deep gulp and released a commercial ready \"ahhh\" before going back to your cock for any residue.  You were embarrassed the rest of the night as we laughed, kissed, and cuddled. I think about it on occasion as it was the first time I had fully accepted someone entirely. Was it love? Maybe. But it was definitely a whole lot of cum. ", "1857": "I was couch surfing with an acquaintance, a woman about ten years older than me.

I was under the Manhattan Bridge Archway attending an annual event from the Business Improvement District. A couple of coworkers were being honored for their work in the community. I was assisting a photographer that night by getting names and emails of everyone photographed. I asked this young man his name and wrote down his information and thought nothing of it. Later on that night our paths crossed again. I acknowledged him with a typical New York head nod since I remembered our previous interaction. He smiled at me and that was when I felt the most engulfing feeling in my chest, something I had never experienced in my 23 years of living. I continued helping the photographer that night, walked back to the office with everyone and skipped out to head back to the venue in search of this beautiful mysterious being. I remember sitting in the space pretending to text while scoping the vicinity for a glimpse of this guy. I started interacting with an acquaintance and his eyes were on me the entire time. I decided to do something I've literally never done before that time... I walked up to him and introduced myself. As it turns out we were both in similar stages in our lives, same age, same city of origin, it literally was fate.
